    <p>After I graduate High School, I'm planning on attending either SFU or UBC for Computer Science. From what ive found, the average cost of tuiton for 4 years of study is $31,000. To be able to pay for these tuition costs, i have a plan in place. Fortunately, my parents have been putting money away for me to use for my university tuition, but this isnt going to cover the full amount, so i am going to be working part time to be able to pay the rest of the tuition costs. Due to SFU and UBC being in close enough proximity to where i live, I am lucky enough i wont have to pay for housing fees to live at the university, but instead of that, i will need to drive and pay for the gas in my car to travel to and from the university.

    <p>My capstone is focused on computer programming. Ever since elementary school, I've always been curious about how videogames are created, primarily on the programming aspect. During elementary school, I used a program called Scratch, it was a block code tool which was a good starting place and taught me some of the beginning steps behind programming. Then in middle school, we were taught how to operate a robot named "Sphero", we could then program its movement and make it do certain tasks. Finally, in High School, I was able to take dedicated Computer Programming courses. In grade 10, I learned how to code in Python and C-Sharp, i used this coding knowledge in an attempt to make a robot using Circuit Python, it was able to play an R2D2 sound.  Then the next year in grade 11, I took a course dedicated to the creation of my own game, which you were to code using coding blocks. I then took it further, when I started coding some elements of the game in C-Sharp. Then this year in grade 12, I have joined the robotics club and coding club here at centennial.</p>

  <p> Over my 4 years of Highschools, there have been some memorable moments. In grade 9, we had the quarter system, having 3 hour long days was pretty enjoyable, having way to much free time was probably the most memorable moment from Grade 9. In grade 10, this is where I took my first Computer Programming class, which was probably the most fun ive had in a single class for a long time, i was able to create and code projects, and it was an easy class aswell which was nice. In grade 11, I took a course focused on Game Design. This class was memorable because after i was finished the class, i was left with a game that looked half decent. This class had both design elements, where we created our own character for the game using Blender. This course also had a programming aspect, where we coded with blocks and C# in unity.   </p>

    <p>During the last few years, i have created multiple projects, including a game and this website.</p>

    <p>Here is the city in my game, I created this project using mainly block code inside of Unity. Some smaller parts were coded in C#, which extended my learning throught that project and allowed me to add more to my game.</p>

    <p>I have also coded this very website using HTML. Although it is a basic website, ive learned various new techniques regarding HTML, including some new functions. I also research ways to allow me to have images width that are shown in the website change, correlating to the actual device that it is being shown on. Another thing i learned while making this website, is how much CSS and HTML go hand in hand when making a website, for instance the buttons on the side of the screen, those are possible with CSS. Without CSS on a website, the website would lack style.</p>
